## perceval-mozilla 0.1 - (2017-01-19)

** New features and improvements: **

* New set of backends added:
   - Kitsune
   - Mozilla Club
   - ReMo
* Backends updated to be compatible with Perceval 0.5, using the namespace
  schema and the new implementation of `BackendCommand`.

** Bugs fixed: **

* Offset was not stored in ReMo cache. This caused errors when trying
  to resume with items from the cache. (#1)
